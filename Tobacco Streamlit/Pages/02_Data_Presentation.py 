### Sources and Datasets
We use publicly available [**WHO Global Tobacco Control Data (2000–2022)**](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.Tobacco?lang=en), covering:
-        MPOWER Overview – Policy compliance scores
-        National tobacco control programmes – Tobacco resource allocation figures
-        Retail price + national tax – Prices and taxes on tobacco
-        Non-age-standardized estimates of current tobacco use
-        Age-standardised estimates of current tobacco use

And added later in the Cleaning and Pre-processing of publicly available [**World Bank Open Data**](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators) to enrich our dataset, covering:
-        CLASS – IncomeGroup and Continental Classification

📎 All datasets were audited and previewed in a combined summary table.  
🔎 *Note: “Region” refers to countries, territories, or areas (renamed from ‘country’ for consistency).*

### Variable Structure

#### Identification Variables
* 🌍 **Region** – 162 countries, territories or areas (renamed from "country")  
→ Example: Germany, Kenya, Brazil
* 🗺️ **Continental Classification** – Countries grouped by continent  
→ South Asia, Europe & Central Asia, MENA, East Asia & Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America & Caribbean, North America
* 💰 **Income Group** – World Bank classification of countries by income  
→ Low, Lower Middle, Upper Middle, High

#### Explanatory Variables
* 📏 **Tobacco Control Measures (MPOWER)** – Six key policy areas scored on a 1–5 scale  
→ Monitor, Protect, Offer, Warn, Enforce, Raise

→ Assesses economic deterrents to smoking (e.g., affordability, excise taxes, price levels)
* 🧑‍💼 **Resource Allocation & Governance** – National strategy and capacity  
→ Annual budget (USD), staff numbers, and existence of a tobacco control agency

#### Outcome Variables
* 🚭 **Non-age-standardised Tobacco Use Prevalence (%)**  
→ Direct prevalence estimates for smoking
* 📊 **Age-standardised Tobacco Use Prevalence (%)**  
→ Adjusted for demographic differences
* 👩‍🦱👨‍🦰 **Gender-Stratified Tobacco Use Prevalence (%)**  
→ Separate estimates for males and females
