        Tobacco use is one of the leading causes of preventable death, causing over 8 million deaths annually.

        - Lung cancer

        - Respiratory conditions
        - Stroke

        In addition to health impacts, tobacco use places a significant economic burden on healthcare systems and reduces global productivity.  
        Smoking prevalence varies widely‚Äîfrom **0.4% to 35.7%** across countries.
