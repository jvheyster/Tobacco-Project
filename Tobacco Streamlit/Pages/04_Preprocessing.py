    The table originally included both taxes and cigarette prices, but we kept only the latter, as taxes expressed as a percentage of prices did not provide additional meaningful insights. We also removed cigarette prices in local currency and US dollars, opting instead for prices in international dollarsâ€”a hypothetical unit that reflects the same purchasing power parity (PPP) as the US dollar at a given point in time. This allows for more accurate cross-country comparisons without exchange rate distortions.
