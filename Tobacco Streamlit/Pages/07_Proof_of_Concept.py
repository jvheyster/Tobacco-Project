Our statistical analysis aimed to identify the individual impacts of tobacco control policies on tobacco use prevalence.
We used a series of fixed effects regression models, adjusted for multicollinearity, interaction effects, and stratified by
income level, region, and gender to assess the robustness and policy relevance of each intervention.

    **Risk Warnings**: Consistently effective, especially in LMICs and East Asia & Pacific â€” likely due to low-cost, standardized design (e.g., pack labeling) and strong impact in low-awareness settings.

    **Advertisement Bans**: Often linked to higher smoking rates â€” possibly due to weak enforcement, policy loopholes, or reactive adoption in response to rising use.
