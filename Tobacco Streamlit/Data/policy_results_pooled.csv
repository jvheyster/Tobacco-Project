Policy,Coefficient (P-Value),Interpretation
Risk Warning,-0.3382 (P=0.034),"Consistently effective across models, particularly in LMICs and East Asia & Pacific. May be due to lower baseline awareness and strong implementation fidelity."
Advertisement Ban,0.2972 (P=0.001),"Counterintuitive positive association. Likely due to policy loopholes, delayed implementation, or industry adaptation."
Cigarette Price,Not significant,"No effect in pooled model. Later found effective for women in HICs, potentially due to gendered price sensitivity."
Media Campaign,Not significant,Limited standalone effect. Slight signal in stratified HIC and regional models.
Cessation Support,Not significant,"No clear effect in pooled model. Some stratified models suggest increase, possibly due to substitution or quit attempt dynamics."
Exposure Protection,Not significant,"Borderline in one model, otherwise not significant. Could reflect exposure differences by gender."
Tax Increase,Not significant,Lack of significance may reflect compensatory behaviors or tax enforcement weaknesses.
